# pali-canon

original, translations, site generation software

looks too ambitiously? I know.

## Progress

for now there is:
* mainly an idea to use github as a nice storage for translations
* translations will be used to generate static site with `nanoc` *soon hopefully*
* canon in markdown as a gem :) *almost here*

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'pali-canon'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pali-canon
